This repo contains the material for a pilot workshop on GitHub Desktop at [Amsterdam UMC](https://www.amsterdamumc.org/en/research.html). The workshop is intended for students and researchers with zero experience of git/GitHub but with some familiarity with R.

You can find online versions of the [worksheet](https://rpubs.com/langton_/githubdesktop) and [slides](https://rpubs.com/langton_/githubdesktopslides) on rpubs.
